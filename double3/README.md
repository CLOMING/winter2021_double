# Double3SDK
See [double3sdk/README.md](double3sdk/README.md).

# App
OpenCV based app
## Installiation
### Python `3.10.0`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Opencv
We need to build opencv manually to use Nvidia Jetson TX2
See [install-opencv.md](install-opencv.md).

If you are not going to use the Nvidia Jetson camera, you can install opencv more easily.
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
## Run
```bash
bash run.sh
```
